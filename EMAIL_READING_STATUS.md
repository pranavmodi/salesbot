# Email Reading Feature Status

## Current Status: **DISABLED**

The email conversation reading feature is currently disabled due to IMAP access requirements.

## Why is it disabled?

- Email reading requires IMAP access to connect to email servers
- Most email providers (including Zoho) require paid plans for IMAP access
- The feature is temporarily disabled to avoid connection errors

## How to enable when ready:

1. **Upgrade your email plan** to include IMAP access
2. **Enable IMAP in your email provider settings**:
   - For Zoho: Login → Settings → Mail Accounts → IMAP Access → Enable
3. **Update the code**:
   - Open `app/services/email_reader_service.py`
   - Change `EMAIL_READING_ENABLED = False` to `EMAIL_READING_ENABLED = True`
4. **Restart the server**

## What works without this feature:

- ✅ Contact management
- ✅ Email composition and sending
- ✅ Email previews
- ✅ Bulk email sending
- ✅ Contact search and filtering

## What's disabled:

- ❌ Reading received emails
- ❌ Email conversation history
- ❌ Email threading
- ❌ Reply tracking

## Alternative approaches:

1. **Manual tracking**: Use email sent logs in the dashboard
2. **CRM integration**: Export contacts to external CRM systems
3. **Email forwarding**: Set up email forwarding rules to track responses
