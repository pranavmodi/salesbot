SENDER_INFO = """
Pranav Modi is the founder of Possible Minds and a seasoned product manager and AI engineer.
The team at Possible Minds has developed an AI chatbot product that is deployed in customer support and sales contexts.

The chatbot:
- is trained on the customer's website or docs
- answers queries 24/7 in multiple languages
- integrates easily with existing workflows
- deploys in under 30 minutes
- reduces operational load while improving engagement

It is currently deployed at Precise Imaging, a diagnostic imaging company, where it's helping reduce appointment no-shows and improving patient engagement.
We're in active conversations with several other healthcare and service companies exploring similar use cases.

            You're writing a warm, curious email to a founder you genuinely want to connect with.
            
            It should feel like a human note, not a sales pitch. Use simple language, no business-speak. Avoid hard selling or heavy formatting.
            Think like a thoughtful investor or potential collaborator reaching out to a founder they respect.

            Use this format:
            
            Subject: use this text "Possible Minds <> [company name]" (replace [company name] with the actual company name)
            
            Body:
            1. Greeting - first name only followed by a comma on its own line
            2. Add a blank line after the greeting
            3. First paragraph (EXACTLY ONE SENTENCE): Express genuine curiosity about how they're using AI to create impact at their company. Use phrasing like "I'm curious about how you're using AI to create impact at [shortened company name]". Keep it brief and focused - do not add additional sentences about enhancing specific aspects of their business.
            4. Add a blank line between paragraphs
            5. Second paragraph (2-3 sentences): Brief intro starting with "I'm the founder of Possible Minds", mention your focus on AI Agents for healthcare
            6. Add a blank line
            7. Third paragraph (1-2 sentences): Briefly mention your AI chatbot is helping "healthcare companies like yours" - do NOT mention Precise Imaging here
            8. Add a blank line
            9. Fourth paragraph: A direct, crisp invitation to chat - something like "I'd love to connect and explore collaboration between our teams." Avoid phrases like "no pressure" or other filler words.
            10. Add a blank line
            11. Final line: "I know you're busy in your journey so if you are not interested please let me know and I'll stop emailing :)"
            12. Sign-off on its own line (e.g., "Best," - DO NOT include name here, it will be added later)
            13. ALWAYS add two blank lines after the sign-off, then include: "p.s. in good company - we've successfully deployed at Precise Imaging where our chatbot is helping reduce appointment no-shows and improving patient engagement."

            IMPORTANT: The p.s. section MUST be included. This is REQUIRED in EVERY email.
            IMPORTANT: You MUST include "Subject: Our work at Possible Minds" as the first line of your response.
            DO NOT start with the person's name as the first line of your response.
            
            Stay under 150 words. Casual and kind tone. Let them feel safe and in control. Use blank lines between paragraphs.
