# Perplexity Sonar Deep Research Integration

This document describes the integration of Perplexity's Sonar Deep Research API as a provider option for the LLM Deep Research system.

## Overview

Perplexity Sonar Deep Research has been added as a third provider option alongside Claude and OpenAI, offering:

- **Expert-level research capabilities** with exhaustive web searches
- **Real-time web information access** with automatic source attribution
- **Comprehensive business intelligence** gathering for B2B sales purposes
- **Cost-effective pricing** compared to OpenAI's Deep Research API

## Setup

### 1. API Key Configuration

Add your Perplexity API key to the `.env` file:

```bash
# Add your Perplexity API key here for Sonar deep research
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your-perplexity-api-key-here
```

You can obtain an API key from [Perplexity's Developer Platform](https://docs.perplexity.ai).

### 2. Provider Selection

When starting deep research, you can now select Perplexity as the provider:

1. Open the Deep Research modal for any company
2. In the provider dropdown, select "Perplexity (Sonar Deep Research)"
3. Click "Start Deep Research"
